The practice for this week comes in the form of an interactive tutorial:

[**Describing Data with Numerical Summaries and Graphics**](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/)  
[https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/)

There is nothing to submit for this problem set but please attest that you have worked through the tutorial on Gradescope.
