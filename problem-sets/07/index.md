You are welcome to write your problem set either by hand, using Word / Google Doc, or putting your answers in an .Rmd file in RStudio. The important thing is that they be uploaded to Gradescope as a PDF file. If you are writing your answers by hand, please use a phone cam scanner app instead of simply taking photos.

Problem sets are meant to be additional practice and they are graded credit / no credit. Credit is given for assignments that demonstrate earnest engagement on the majority of the problems.
