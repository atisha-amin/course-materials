**Due on Gradescope at 10 pm Monday 1/24**

The first problem set is a pair of surveys. The *Welcome Survey* acquaints you with the course syllabus and helps us understand where you're coming from in taking this course. The responses will be read by your GSIs and not shared publicly. The *Data Collection* is a mix of different questions that will help generate a data set that we will draw on throughout the course. Please assume that any answers entered into the Data Collection survey will be public.

Upon completing the survey, please visit Problem Set 1 on Gradescope and answer one question that references the surveys.
