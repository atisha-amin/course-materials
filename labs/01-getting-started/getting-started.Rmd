title: "Lab 1: Getting Started with RStudio and Markdown"
output: pdf_document
---

The goals of this lab are very practical:

1. learn where to find the labs (you have succeeded!)
2. login to the RStudio server (success again!)
3. create your first empty RMarkdown file
4. knit it
5. then modify it
6. knit again
7. download pdf and submit to gradescope

Please make the following modifications to your lab file. Be sure to knit it after every step to see what changed.

1. Create a new RMarkdown file

2. Add `author: Your Name` on a new line within the header.

3. Delete everything after the header.

4. Add a new title `## My home county: {homecounty, state}`. If you're from abroad, instead use `## Where I'd like to visit: {county, state}`.

5. Copy and paste the first few paragraphs from that county's Wikipedia page (the bit before the "Contents" section) into the Rmd and remove any unusual formatting.

6. Create a new section called `## My three favorite spots near my home` and list them in an enumerated list.

Make one final knit, be sure you're happy with your report, then download it to your computer and upload it to [gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com).
