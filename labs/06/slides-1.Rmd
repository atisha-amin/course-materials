# The Chancellor's Survey

---

1) What was the goal(s) of the Chancellor's office in commissioning this survey?

2) To which population does the Chancellor's office wish to generalize their findings?

3) Describe two parameters that the Chancellor's office is trying to estimate using the survey data.

5) Describe one scenario wherein this response rate would lead to results that they could not generalize from the sample to the population. Be specific.

# From Questionnaire to Data


---

7) Sketch a data frame of what the first 5 rows of the data frame might look like that contains the responses from the first 5 students. Include columns showing what the data might look like that comes out of questions 1, 7, and 8. Note that in the data set, the data values are all translated from words into numbers. Speculate as to how this translation is done.


---

8) Sketch a plot of what the data might look like that is generated by each of the following survey questions. Note that this should be done without looking at the actual data frame.  
    a. Question 9  
    b. Question 10  
    c. Question 18 and 21 (showing the change from before and after the information)
