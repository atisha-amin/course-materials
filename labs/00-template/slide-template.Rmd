## The best way to do images is with an r chunk

```{r}
#| out.width = "10%"
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/about_mega.jpg")
```

--


```{r}
#| out.width = "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/about_mega.jpg")
```


---
## Here is R code

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE
rnorm(100)
```

---
## Sometimes you want to take it slow

--

```{r makingNorms}
#| echo = TRUE
#| eval = FALSE
rnorm(100)
```

--

```{r}
#| ref.label = "makingNorms"
#|echo = FALSE
```
