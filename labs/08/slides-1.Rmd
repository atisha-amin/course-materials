# Lab 8: Elections
### Introduction to Probability and Statistics

???

## Timing

[15 min] Introduction to Benford's Law using primarily boardwork
[3 min] Introduction to Iran Election context (slides)
[15 min] Students work on EDA portion
[5 min] Review as a class things that came up during EDA
[5 min] Show how to use first digit function (slides)
[remaining] Students continue working on remaining problems

This first component can be done either during Berkeley time or at the start of class along with students. It depends on how long you expect the rest of the lesson to take and what you'd like to emphasize:
[Write on the board the two "fundamental" distributions that we've covered so far: the Binomial and the Bernoulli. https://www.stat20.org/lectures/14/binomial.html#/bernoulli-distributionl will give you a sense of the notation and layout that's used. Best to replicate each element of these slides, including the plots.] 

It's reasonable to ask students to close their laptops for the first part of class.

Ask students for a guess or two at the population of Berkeley.  Write on board then go to Wikipedia and get the true answer and correct the one(s) on the board. From there, follows links through Wikipedia to other towns and cities in California, building up a list of 10 city names and their populations (randomly picking a few of these links is a good method: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Incorporated_cities_and_towns_in_California). Structure this on the board as a data frame with two columns: city and population, and 10 rows.

Ask students to sketch the distribution of two variables:
1. What they expect the population variable to look like were they to collect the population of all the cities and towns in California.
2. The distribution of the value of the first digit in the population counts of all of these town.
This is probably best done think-pair share: give a couple minutes to for them to sketch silently, then ask them to share with a neighbor, then ask a pair to describe their distributions as you draw it on the board.

Probing questions:
1. Where does this variable sit in the Data Taxonomy?
2. What is the range of possible values this variable can take?
3. What geometry will you use?
4. What shape/modality/center/spread would you expect to see?
5. What labels belong on the axes?
6. What is a good title for this plot?

The first should be a histogram or density plot (boxplot is meh) that is heavily right skewed. The second should be a barchart on the integers 1-9, each one having decreasing probabilities.

Write out Benford's Law in a similar way to the other named distributions and describe it as a distribution that we're going to try to use to describe vote counts. Start the calculation of E and V of Benford's Law just so that students can see what goes into each term of those sums (I'm actually not sure what the base_10 Benfords E and V are).

# Benford's Law

## Benford's Law

Observation: many naturally occurring numerical variables have a recurring pattern in the distribution of the first digit.

--

Benford's law states that

--

- The first digit of the measurement of a naturally occurring phenomenon takes a **decreasing** log distribution.

--

- Thus the numbers 1-9 are not distributed uniformly. Instead, 1 has the highest proportion and 9 has the lowest proportion. 

--

- For example, first digits of stock prices, populations of cities, and election results are observed to follow the Benford's Law.

---
## Benford's Law

```{r benford_code, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
benfords_p <- data.frame(first_digit = 1:9, 
                         ben_prop = log10(1 + 1/1:9))
```

```{r benford_plot, eval = TRUE}
#| fig.width = 5.5,
#| fig.height = 3.3
library(tidyverse)
colnames(benfords_p) <- c("digit", "prop")
ggplot(benfords_p, aes(x = digit, y = prop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:9)

# 2009 Iran Election

## 2009 Iran Election

--

.pull-left[
**Background**

- Ongoing public sentiment that previous election was fraudulent
- The highest voter turnout in Iran's history

**Leading candidates**

- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: Leader of conservatives and incumbent president. 
- Mir-Hossein Mousavi: Reformist and former prime minister. Seeking rapid political evolution.
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/iran-pols.png")
```

**Outcome**

Ahmadinejad won the election with 62.6% of the votes cast, while Mousavi received 33.75% of the votes cast.
]

---
## Post-election controversies and unrest

- Allegations of fraud
- Public protests and unrests
- The green wave movement, led by Mousavi, against the allegedly fraudulent election and Ahmadinejad's regime

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%", out.height="20%",fig.cap=" ",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("slides-1_files/figure-html/iran_green3.jpg","slides-1_files/figure-html/iran_green2.jpg"))

# Exploring election data

---
## Exploring election data

Let's take a look at the dataset

1. What is the unit of observation in the Iran data frame? What are the dimensions?

2. Which cities had the highest proportion of total votes cast for Ahmadinejad? Please return the top several city names along with the province name and the proportions.

3. Which cities had the highest proportion of total votes cast for Mousavi? Please return the top several city names along with the province name and the proportions.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(4, font_size = "2em")
```

---
Explore the election results 

4.How many cities did Mousavi win?

5.How does the proportion of total votes that were voided compare between cities won by Mousavi and cities won by Ahmadinejad? This can be answered either with a plot or with summary statistics. Describe in words how they compare.

6.What proportion of the total votes cast were won by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi, respectively?



```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(5, font_size = "2em")
```

# Benford's Law in Iran

---
## Fraud detection using Benford's Law

--

- Find the distribution of the first digit of vote counts.

--

- Compare this distribution with Benford's law.

--

- A significant deviation from Benford's law may indicate a potentially fraudeulent election.


---
## Finding First Digits

```{r, echo = TRUE}
substr("A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...", 21, 28)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
substr(387, 1, 2)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
as.numeric(substr(387, 1, 2))
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
get_first(387)
```

---
Using Benford's law

7.What proportion of vote counts for Ahmadinejad have “1” as a first digit?

8.Create a plot showing the distribution of first digits in the Ahmadinejad’s vote counts. Does this plot appear to match the ideal Benford’s distribution? Where does it deviate?

9.Would you consider this meaningless, weak, moderate, or strong evidence of election fraud? Why or why not?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(5, font_size = "2em")
```

## Distribution of first digits in Iran

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
library(stat20data)
library(patchwork)
data(iran)
p1 <- iran %>%
  mutate(first_digit = get_first(ahmadinejad)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = first_digit)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "first digit",
       title = "Ahmadinejad Vote Data")

benfords_p <- data.frame(first_digit = 1:9, 
                         ben_prop = log10(1 + 1/1:9))
colnames(benfords_p) <- c("digit", "prop")
p2 <- ggplot(benfords_p, aes(x = digit, y = prop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:9) +
  labs(title = "Benford's Law")
p1 + p2
```
