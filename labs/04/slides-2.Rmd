# Lab 4: Flights II
### Introduction to Probability and Statistics


---
## Agenda

--

1. Review data pipelines

--

2. Review group_by()  and summarize()

--

3. Flights data with ggplot

# Data Pipelines

---
## The Pipe Operator
Using the `%>%` from `tidyverse` helps break data frame manipulations into successive steps.

--

Consider counting the total number of flights between the Bay Area and LAX.

--

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
summarise(filter(flights,dest == "LAX"), count = n())
```

--

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "LAX") %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```


---

# group_by() and summarize()

---

## Flights by month

Combined with the pipeline, `group_by()` and `summarize()` provide a good way for summary statistics.

--

```{r eval=TRUE,  echo=TRUE}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

---

## Comparison Operators
--

There are many comparisons that can be made for (usually) categorical data (`==`, `!=`, `%in%`) and for numerical data (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/comparison-operators.png")
```

---

## Logical Vectors
--

Multiple logical constraints can be placed on your variables in the `filter()` function.

--

Selecting flights to Boston:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "BOS")
```

--

Selecting flights from SFO to Boston:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>%
  filter(origin == "SFO",
         dest == "BOS")
```

---
## Logical Vectors (continued)

Selecting flights from SFO to Boston or Philadelphia:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>%
  filter(origin == "SFO",
         dest %in% c("BOS", "PHL"))
```

# Part II: Computing with the Data - continued

---
## Summarize the data

14. Create a data frame that contains the median and interquartile range for departure delays, grouped by carrier. Which carrier has the lowest typical departure delay? Which one has the least variable departure delays?

---
## Simple ggplots

7. Create a bar chart that shows the distribution by month of all the flights leaving the Bay Area (SFO and OAK). Do you any sign of an effect of the pandemic?

---
## dplyr + ggplot 

12. Create a plot that captures the relationship of average speed vs. distance and describe the shape and structure that you see. What phenomena related to taking flights from the Bay Area might explain this structure?

9. Add a new column to your data frame called before_times that takes values of TRUE and FALSE indicating whether the flight took place up through the end of March or after April 1st, respectively. Remake the histograms above, but now separated into two subplots: one with the departure delays from the before times, the other with the flights from afterwards. Can you visually detect any difference in the distribution of departure delays?

# Appendix

## Logical Vectors


Logical statements can also be joined together joined with `&` (AND) or `|` (OR).

--

Selecting flights from SFO to Boston or Philadelphia:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>%
  filter(origin == "SFO",
         dest %in% c("BOS","PHL"))
```

--

Alternatively:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
flights %>%
  filter(((origin == "SFO") & ((dest == "BOS") | (dest == "PHL"))))
```
