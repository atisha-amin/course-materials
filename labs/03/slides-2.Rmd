# R Markdown Practice

---
## Creating, naming, and saving your Rmd
--

1. Click the green plus, select R Markdown.
2. Select "From Template" in the left menu and scroll through the list until you see "Lab Report {stat20data}". Select it and click OK.
3. One the second line of the template, change the title field to be the title of this lab.
4. Click the Save button, then name the file something sensible like `lab-3-class-survey`.
5. Click the knit button to see what the pdf of the lab template looks like.

---
## Uploading an image
--

1. Take a clear picture of your first sketched plot with your phone.
2. Transfer the picture to your laptop.
3. In RStudio, click the "Upload" button in the file tab in the lower right pane.
4. Upload the picture to the same directory as your lab Rmd or to a new folder called something like "images".
5. In the lab template, replace the words inside `"path-to-image"` with the name of your file. If you put it into "images", add `images/` to your file name.
6. Knit!

# Summarizing the class survey data

---
## `summarize()`

You can *summarize* the observations in a variable using `summarize()` and the function that you wish to apply to that variable.

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.huge .remark-code { /*Change made here*/
  font-size: 150% !important;
}
```

.huge[
```
summarize(<DATAFRAME>, <FUNCTION>(<VAR>))
```
]

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
```

.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE}
summarize(arbuthnot, sum(girls))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r echo = TRUE}
summarize(arbuthnot, total_g = sum(girls))
```
]

## *Example from Lecture* Deliveries revisited

.pull-left[
```{r}
#| fig.height = 7.5,
#| fig.width = 12

set.seed(513)
oski <- rnorm(23, 0, 2)
oski <- oski + (29 - mean(oski))
cal <- rnorm(23, 0, 8)
cal <- cal +  (27 - mean(cal))
df <- tibble(service = rep(c("oski", "cal"), each = 23),
             time = c(oski, cal))
deliveries <- df
oski <- filter(deliveries, service == "oski")
library(kableExtra)
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(service), nrow = 2) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
p1 + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 27, color = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 29, color = "goldenrod", lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(service) %>%
  summarize(range = diff(range(time)),
            IQR = IQR(time),
            var = var(time),
            sd = sd(time)) %>%
  kbl(digits = 1)
```

**Desiderata**
- The statistic should be *low* when the numbers are the same or very similar to one another.
- The statistic should be *high* when the numbers are very different.
- The statistic should not grow or shrink with the sample size ( $n$ ).

## The code behind the table

```{r echo = TRUE}
summarize(oski, 
          range = diff(range(time)),
          IQR = IQR(time),
          var = var(time),
          sd = sd(time))
```
