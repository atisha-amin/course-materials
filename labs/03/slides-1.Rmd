# Lab 3: Class Survey
### Introduction to Probability and Statistics

Lab will be begin on Berkeley time 11:10 am.

---
class: middle

# Introductions

---
## Goals
--

1. Familiarize ourselves with the data collected though the class survey in PS 1.

  - Unit of obs, types of variables

--

2. Plan out visualizations to capture relationships in the data and set expectations for the trends that you will see.

--

3. Describe each of the visualizations in terms of the Grammar of Graphics.

--

Please put your laptops away and take out a some paper / tablet for notes and sketches.

## The source of the data: the students of STAT 20

## Part I Questions:
--

1. What is the unit of observation in the class survey?

2. Where in the Taxonomy of Data are the variables that correspond to each of the following survey questions (i.e., what is their type)?
  - Question 6: What is your favorite thing about Cal?
  - Question 13: Where would you rather be?
  - Question 20: What is the chance that we remain in remote learning for the entire semester?

3. What values would you expect `major` to take? Do you anticipate any challenges when analyzing this data?

---

To lay the groundwork for your analysis on the survey data set, you will make a plan for constructing plots and set your expectations for what you will see. For questions 4 - 7, please:

- sketch (with paper and pencil) a plot that captures the distribution or relationship between the variables,
- label the axis and add axis tick marks with plausible values,
- depict a shape that reflects your expectation of the phenomena. Also:
- indicate the *aesthetic mappings* (the variables in use and which visual cues / aeshetic each one is mapped to) and
- indicate the *geometry* of your plot.
  
4) Do students prefer to spend time at the beach or in the mountains?

5) How much coding experience do students have, ranked from 1 - 10?

6) What are students' perceptions of the chance that we remain in remote learning for the entire semester?

7) What is the relationship between students optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?

# Practice with the Grammar of Graphics

## Grammar of Graphics

Wilkinson 1999: A statistical graphic is a **mapping** of **data** variables to **aesthetic** attributes of **geometric** objects.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/grammar-of-graphics.png")

## Practice: Penguin Bill Lengths

What are the **Data**, **Aesthetic Mapping**, and **Geometry** of the following plot?

```{r}
#| fig.width = 9,
#| fig.height = 4
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```

---
## Practice: Penguin Bill Lengths
--

.pull-left[
- **Data**: `penguins`  
- **Aesthetic Mapping**: map `bill_length_mm` to the x-axis
- **Geometry**: express the observations as a histogram 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| fig.width = 9,
#| fig.height = 4
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

---
## Practice: Penguin Bill Lengths Again
--

```{r}
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = girls + boys)
```

.pull-left[
- **Data**: `penguins`  
- **Aesthetic Mapping**: map `bill_length_mm` to the x-axis
- **Geometry**: express the observations as a **bar chart** 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_bar() #<<
```

> What will this do?

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| fig.width = 9,
#| fig.height = 4
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
