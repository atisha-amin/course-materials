<!--## Additional Readings
- John Arbuthnot's Manuscript ([original](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1710.0011), [transcribed](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/arbuthnot.pdf)). Originally entitled *An argument for divine providence, taken from the constant regularity observ'd in the births of both sexes.*, his publication in the proceedings of the Royal Society in 1710 stand out as much for the theogical argument that he makes prescient statistical methods.-->
