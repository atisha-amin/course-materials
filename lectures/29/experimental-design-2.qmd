## Announcements

1. Lab 9
    - due tonight 10 pm
2. PS 10 available 
    - due next Monday 10 pm
    - tutorial videos released Friday


## Agenda

1. Review

2. Case Study I: Acupuncture

3. Case Study II: Smoking and Cancer


# Review

## Where did the data come from?

- Draw a *sample* from a *population*.
- Either conduct an *observational study* or an *experiment*.

. . .

**Observational Study**: researchers collect data from sample in a way that does not interfere with how they arise.

- easier/cheaper
- study historical data
- ethical

**Experiment**: Researchers assign subjects to treatments, then collect the resulting data.

- establish causation. But why?


## {}

::: poll
Why does the principle of random assignment allow us to draw causal inferences?

A. It ensures our sample is representative of our population

B. It removes the effect of the subject knowing the treatment group to which they were assigned

C. It increases the sample size

D. It ensures that, on average, every possible confounding variable should be balanced between the treatment and control groups

## A Causal Claim

[I got a good grade in the course because I went to office hours.]{.smalladage}

. . .

> **Counterfactual**:  
> [_If I hadn't gone to office hours, I would have gotten a worse grade._]{.smalladage}

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(`Unit ID` = c("me", "me"),
             Treatment = c("office hours",
                           "no office hours"),
             Outcome   = c("A",
                           "B"),
             Observed  = c("yes",
                           "no"))
df %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


# Case Study 1: Acupuncture and Pain


## Principles of Experimental Design

**Replication**: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study.

**Control**: Compare treatment of interest to a control group that isolates the effect of interest.

**Blinding**: When experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group

**Random Assignment**: Randomly assign subjects to treatments.


## Example: Acupuncture and pain

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r out.width=500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/acupuncture.png")
```

**Claim**: Traditional acupuncture (needles inserted at specific points on the body) causes a reduction in lower back pain.

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: poll
With a neighbor, discuss how you would test this:

- What is the treatment?
- What is the control?
- How is blinding used?
- How is random assignment used?

## The mounting evidence

- Randomized trials with mice and tobacco tar

- Regression models to "control for" possible confounders

- Identification of physical mechanism

- Twins studies

## Alternate paths from association to causation

# Association and Causation

## If you learn one thing in this class...

```{r out.width=800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/xkcd-correlation.png")
```


## {}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cat-causation.png")
```

Correlation $\ne$ Causation.
