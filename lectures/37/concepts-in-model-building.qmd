## Throwback to Probability {.smaller}

::: poll
Consider the following very simple game. You have a 20 sided die with each side equally likely. 19 of the sides have a L for "lose" and one side has a W for "win". In one play of the game, you simply roll the die and win if the W comes up.

How many times would you expect to win if you were to play this game 20 times?

## Ex: LA Homes

We'd like to build a model to explain prices of homes in LA as a function of the characteristics of those homes.

$$ \widehat{price} = location + size + pool + acreage \ldots $$

# Statistical Question

## Asking a question

. . .

**A vague question**: what explains the price of a house in West LA?

. . .

**A specific question**: how do location, size, acreage, and the presence of a pool correspond to the price of a home in West LA?

$$ \widehat{price} = location + size + pool + acreage $$

. . .

> Be clear on if you're doing an _exploratory_ or a _confirmatory_ analysis.


## Two types of analyses

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Exploratory]{.inversebox}

seeks to uncover trends in data to help refine the research question for a subsequent analysis.
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
[Confirmatory]{.inversebox}

starts with a very specific question to confirm an effect found in a previous analysis.

# Data Wrangling  

## Data Wrangling

Home price data is available on many websites now, including zillow.com.

```{r load-data, echo = FALSE}
LA <- read_csv("images/LA.csv") %>%
  tibble()
```

```{r}
head(LA, 5)
```

. . .

**Unit of observation**: a home for sale in west LA.

. . .

::: poll
To which **population** would you feel comfortable generalizing using this data? (you many select several)

Why?

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(2, font_size = "1.5em")

## Data wrangling, cont.

```{r data-2}
glimpse(LA)
```


## Data wrangling: `city`

. . .

```{r cntcity, eval = FALSE}
LA %>%
  count(city)
```

. . . 

```{r ref.label = "cntcity", echo = FALSE}
```


## Data wrangling: `type` {auto-animate=true}

. . .

```{r cnttype, eval = FALSE}
LA %>%
  count(type)
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "cnttype", echo = FALSE}
```

. . .

<br>

If you wish to change the _levels_ of a categorical variable, you need to _recode_ it.


## Data wrangling: `type` {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(type = fct_recode(type,
                           "condo"   = "Condo/Twh",
                           "sfr"     = "SFR"))
```


## Data wrangling: `type` {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(type = fct_recode(type,
                           "unknown" = "",
                           "condo"   = "Condo/Twh",
                           "sfr"     = "SFR"))
```

```{r}
LA %>%
  count(type)
```



## Data wrangling, cont.

. . .

```{r}
glimpse(LA)
```


## Data wrangling: `garage` {auto-animate=true}

```{r data-4, eval = FALSE}
LA %>%
  count(garage)
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "data-4", echo = FALSE}
```

We can _combine_ levels of a categorical variable using a similar approach.


## Data wrangling: `garage` {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(garage_cat = fct_collapse(garage,
                                   "small" = c("", "1"),
                                   "large" = c("2", "3", "4+")))
```


## Data wrangling: `garage` {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(garage_cat = fct_collapse(garage,
                                   "small" = c("", "1"),
                                   "large" = c("2", "3", "4+")))
```

```{r}
LA %>%
  count(garage)
```


## Data wrangling: `garage`

**Alternative**: We can drop the ill-specified observations and convert the data type.

. . .

```{r}
LA_alt <- LA %>%
  filter(garage != "4+") %>%
  mutate(garage_n = as.integer(garage))
```

. . .

```{r}
LA_alt %>%
  count(garage_n)
```



## Data wrangling, cont.

. . .

```{r}
glimpse(LA)
```

> What's going on with `pool` and `spa`?


## Data wrangling: `pool` and `spa`

. . .

:::: columns
::: {.column width="47%"}
```{r}
LA %>%
  count(pool)
```

<br>
<br>

```{r}
LA %>%
  summarize(nas = sum(is.na(spa)))
```
:::
::: {.column width="6%"}
:::
::: {.column width="47%" .fragment}
Two variables seem mis-coded/uninformative, so they could be dropped.

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  select(-pool, -spa)
```
:::
::::


## Fully wrangled data set

. . .

```{r}
head(LA)
```

<br>

Once the data set is ready to go, save it to a new .csv file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
write_csv(LA, file = "LA.csv")
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

. . .

Our goals are to:

. . .

1. Develop a sense of the *univariate* distributions in terms of center, shape, spread, unusual observations.
2. Develop a sense of the *bivariate* and *multivariate* distributions and what
they indicate about the relationship between variables.

## EDA for `price`  

. . .

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(LA, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)

**Question**: How would you visualize the relationship between `price` and `city`?

```{r}
head(LA)
```


## {}

**Question**: How would you visualize the relationship between `price` and `city`?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(LA, aes(x = city, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```


## {}

**Question**: How would you visualize the relationship between `price` and `sqft`?

```{r}
head(LA)
```


## {}

**Question**: How would you visualize the relationship between `price` and `sqft`?

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(LA, aes(x = sqft, y = price)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```


## Transformations  

Highly skewed data (particularly the response) can be very difficult to model using least squares regression. A common solution is to consider a transformation of the variable.

. . .

$$ \widehat{price} \sim sqft $$

versus

$$\widehat{log(price)} \sim log(sqft) $$

. . .

In R: `log()` or `log10()`


## EDA for `price`  

. . .

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(logprice = log(price))
```

. . .

```{r warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(LA, aes(x = logprice)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```


## EDA for `logprice` and `logsqft`

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(logsqft = log(sqft))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(LA, aes(x = logsqft, y = logprice)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 18)
```

$$\widehat{log(price)} \sim log(sqft) $$
:::

## Comparing residuals

. . .

```{r}
m1 <- lm(price ~ sqft, data = LA)
m2 <- lm(logprice ~ logsqft, data = LA)
```

. . .

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}
library(patchwork)
p1 <- qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m1, main = "model 1") +
  theme_bw()
p2 <- qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m2, main = "model 2") +
  theme_bw()
p1 + p2
```


## Transformation, cont.

. . .

Highly skewed data often leads to invalid models. This can be often be fixed 
with a transformation, but the interpretations change slightly.

. . .

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(m2)$coef
```

*A one unit increase in the log sqft of a home is associated with a 1.44 unit
increase in the log price of a home.*


## Dummy Variables

. . .

```{r dum, eval = FALSE}
m3 <- lm(logprice ~ logsqft + city, data = LA)
LA %>%
  count(city)
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "dum", echo = FALSE}
```

> How can we encode a categorical variable like `city` into a numerical variable so that we can include it in our model?

## {}

boardwork


## {}

```{r sum3, eval = FALSE}
summary(m3)
```

. . .

```{r ref.label = "sum3", echo = FALSE}
```


## Dummy Variables, cont.

- Categorical variables with $k$ levels can be recoded as $k - 1$ dummy variables (also called indicator variables or one-hot encoding).
- The level that is left out of the dummy variables is called the **reference level** and by default is the first alphabetically. The `intercept` estimate refers to this level.
- The levels encoded by dummies have a coefficient that captures the deviation of their intercept to the reference level.


## Assessing model fit

Our existing statistic to measure how well the model captures the variability in the data is $R^2$.

$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{TSS}$$

. . .

**Note**: $R^2$ can never decrease when additional variables are added to the model.

A more useful statistic when comparing MLR models of difference complexities is adjusted $R^2$, which balances the ability of the model to explain the data with its simplicity.

$$R^2_{adj} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{TSS} \cdot \frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1} $$
