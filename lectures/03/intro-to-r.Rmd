**Parentheses for Order of Ops.**

## Saving Objects

When you type a line of code (here: math) at the console and press `enter`, R will:

1. Run the code / evaluate the expression
2. *Print* the output to the console

--

If instead you want R to

1. Run the code / evaluate the expression
2. Save the output to an *object*

--

You can use the **assignment operator**.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
<-
```

(less than symbol, hyphen)

class: center, middle

## Saving objects

???

Run stuff like `a <- 1 + 2`, `b <- 2 * 3`, and `a + b`, `a + 1`.

## Saving objects

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/hopr_0102.png")
```


---
## Naming objects

In order to be recognized as a valid object name, you have to certain conventions; namely, the object name should begin with a letter.

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
tibble(`good names` = c("a", "b", "FOO", "my_var"), `names that cause errors` = c("1trial", "$", "^mean", "my var")) %>%
  kbl()
```

### What will happen here?

a <- 1 + 2
a + 1
```

What will happen here?

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
a <- 1 + 2
a + 1
```

--

To update an object, you can overwrite it by assigning it to the same name.

--

```{r update_a, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1 + 2
a <- a + 1
a
```
--
```{r ref.label = "update_a", echo = FALSE}
```

## Creating a Vector

One of the core data structure in R is the *vector*, a one-dimensional ordered set of values.
--
 You can create a vector using a function called `c()` for *combine* or *concatenate*.

Demo running this line of code, then running `?mean`

---
## Getting help
--

One of the most useful commands in R is `?`.

.pull-left[

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?mean
```

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/help-mean.png")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Look for:
- Which arguments are available
- What kind of output the function will return (called the "Value")
- Look at the examples at the bottom
]

???
Demo

a <- c(-5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100)
mean(a)
mean(a, trim = .1)
a_no_extremes <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
mean(a_no_extremes)

---
## Multiple arguments

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- c(-5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100)
mean(x = a, trim = .1)
```

A few notes:

--

1. Functions can take multiple arguments separated by a comma: `,`

--

2. Arguments have names that you can specify or leave blank

--

3. Some arguments have default values that will be used if you specify something different


---
## So many functions...

There are many functions in R, most of them named sensibly.

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
mean(a)
sum(a)
length(a)
```

---
## Functions on vectors
--

Many of them will operate element-by-element if given a vector argument.

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sqrt(a)
log(a)
abs(a)
```

--

Note: `log()` is the natural log by default (log base $e = 2.71$).

---
### What will happen here?

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sqrt(log(a))
```

Functions can be *nested* and will evaluate from the inside out.

## The Taxonomy of Data

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/taxonomy-of-data.png")
```

--

Every vector in R has a *type* that defines the way that it is stored and a *class* that determines how it will behave.

---
## Common classes of vectors: `numeric`
--

You can ask R for the class of an object using the `class()` function.

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(a)
```

--

`numeric` objects map directly to *numeric variables*, with no strong distinction between continuous and discrete.

--

- You may also see related types such as `integer` and `dbl` (for double precision).

---
## Common classes of vectors: `character`
--

`character` vectors contain *strings*, identified by being enclosed in quotation marks.

```{r echo = TRUE}
greetings <- c("hello", "hola", "ni hao", "heisann")
greetings
```

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
class(greetings)
```

---
### What will happen here?

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
1 + "one"
```

</center>

---
### What will happen here?

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, error=TRUE}
1 + "one"
```

--

Most functions (included arithmetic operators) will only work on objects of a certain class.

A function that only operates on character vectors:

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
greetings <- c("hello", "hola", "ni hao", "heisann")
toupper(greetings)
```


---
## Common classes of vectors: `factor`
--

`factor` vectors contain categorical data where we expect there to be multiple observations at the same level. You will find them often in pre-loaded data set but you can construct them using `factor()`.

```{r echo = TRUE}
greetings <- factor(c("hello", "hello", "ni hao"))
greetings
```

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
class(greetings)
```

--

`factor` is a natural class for *categorical variables*.

---
## The Taxonomy of Data in R

--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/taxonomy-of-data.png")
```

--

In R you will generally see:
- `numeric` for *continuous* and *discrete* numerical variables
- `factor` and `character` for *nominal* categorical variables
- There is an `ordered` factor for *ordinal* variables

# Building Data Frames

---
## Recall from last lecture...
--

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/lter_penguins.png")
```

Kristen Gorman set out to record and publish observations made on adult penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

---
## Penguins data frame

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  sample_n(4) %>%
  kbl()
```

--

.task[
What is the unit of observation?  
What are the types of variables in the Taxonomy of Data?  
What classes do those correspond to in R?  
]

--

> Let's see if we can build this data frame...

---

Demo

---
## Building a data frame

You can combine vectors into a data frame using the `tibble()` function from the extension library of R that we'll be using called the `tidyverse`.

```{r echo = TRUE}
bill_depth_mm <- c(15.0, 17.1, 18.7, 18.9)
bill_length_mm <- c(47.5, 40.2, 39.0, 35.3)
species <- c("Gentoo", "Adelie", "Adelie", "Adelie")
```

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins_df <- tibble(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species)
```

---
## The penguins data frame
--

```{r echo = TRUE}
penguins_df
```
