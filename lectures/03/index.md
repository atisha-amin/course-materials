Understanding, visualizing, and drawing conclusions from large and diverse requires a powerful computational tool. The R language for statistical computing is one such tool designed explicitly with this goal in mind.

### Key Questions

1. How can I make basic arithmetic calculations on data?

2. What structure does R use to collect a series of elements / observations that share the same type?

3. How are functions structured in R, how do I specify their input, and how do they behave on vectors?

4. How does R use the classes to encode similar information to that in the Taxonomy of Data?

5. How do I create a data frame?


### Terminology and skills

#### R/RStudio Concepts
- Printing to the console vs saving to the environment
- R scripts as final draft of code, console as the sandbox

#### R Functions
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- `<-`
- `?`
- `library()`
- `c()`
- `class()`
- `sum()`
- `mean()`
- `data()`
- `tibble()`
