## Announcements

1. PS set released this weekend, due next Fri
2. Quiz 4 next Sunday-Monday


## Agenda

1. Study Design and Experiments

2. A Manner of Taste: 4 principles of experimental design.

3. Correlation and Causation


# Study Design and Experiments

## Where did the data come from?

- Draw a *sample* from a *population*.
- Either conduct an *observational study* or an *experiment*.

. . .

**Observational Study**: researchers collect data from sample in a way that does not interfere with how they arise. Why do an observational study?

- easier/cheaper
- study historical data
- ethical

**Experiment**: Researchers assign subjects to treatments, then collect the resulting data. Why do an experiment?

- establish causation. But why?


## Causation in terms of counterfactual

. . .

**Counterfactual**: relating to or expressing what has not happened or is not the case.

. . .

<br>

> We say "A causes B" if, in the world where A didn't happen, B no longer happens.

## A Causal Claim

[I got a good grade in the course because I went to office hours.]{.smalladage}

. . .

> **Counterfactual**:  
> [_If I hadn't gone to office hours, I would have gotten a worse grade._]{.smalladage}

. . .

<br>

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(`Unit ID` = c("me", "me"),
             Treatment = c("office hours",
                           "no office hours"),
             Outcome   = c("A",
                           "B"),
             Observed  = c("yes",
                           "no"))
df %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## The Essential Question of Our Time

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/la-croix.png")
```

::: poll
Which is the best flavor?

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/la-croix.png")
```

::: poll
Could your taster differentiate between flavors?

- Yes
- No
- We tested a different claim

## Principles of Experimental Design

**Replication**: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Or replicate the entire study.

**Control**: Compare treatment of interest to a control group that isolates the effect of interest.

**Blinding**: When experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or treatment group

**Random Assignment**: Randomly assign subjects to treatments.


## Other key ideas

**Double-Blinding**: When neither the experimental units nor the researchers know the assignment of treatments.

**Placebo**: fake treatment, often used as the control group for medical studies.

**Placebo effect**: experimental units showing improvement simply because they believe they are receiving a special treatment.


## Example: Acupuncture and pain

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r out.width=500, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/acupuncture.png")
```

**Claim**: Traditional acupuncture (needles inserted at specific points on the body) causes a reduction in lower back pain.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: poll
With a neighbor, discuss how you would test this:

- What is the treatment?
- What is the control?
- How is blinding used?
- How is random assignment used?

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(5, font_size = "1.5em")

# Correlation and Causation


## {background-image="images/corrs1.png" background-size="contain"}

## {background-image="images/corrs2.png" background-size="contain"}

## If you learn one thing in this class...

```{r out.width=800, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/xkcd-correlation.png")
```


## {}

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cat-causation.png")
```

Correlation $\ne$ Causation.
