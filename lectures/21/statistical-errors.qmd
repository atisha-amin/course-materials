# Hypothesis Testing Review


# One goal for today

[Learn why we don't accept the null hypothesis.]{.bigadage}


## What is it good for?

Hypothesis tests have been shown to be valuable contributors to science ([p < .05]{.fragment .highlight-green})
but are sometimes abused ([p < .05]{.fragment .highlight-green}).

- Used to assess the degree to which data is consistent with a particular model.
- The most widely used tool in statistical inference.


## Step 1

. . .

Lay out your model(s).

$H_0$: null model, business as usual  
$H_A$: alternative model, business not as usual

- Hypotheses are statments about the TRUE STATE of the world and should involve
*parameters*, not *statistics*.
- Hypotheses should suggest a *test statistic* that has some bearing on the claim.
- The nature of $H_A$ determines one- or two-sided tests; default to two.


## Step 2

Construct the appropriate null distribution.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 10, fig.align='center'}
x1  <- 0:75
df <- data.frame(x = x1, y = dbinom(x1, 75, 0.5))
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "darkgreen", fill = "white") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 75/2, sd = sqrt(74/4)), 
                col = "goldenrod", lwd = 1.2)
```

1. Permutation (when `null = "independence"`)
2. Simulation (when `null = "point"`)
3. Exact Probability Theory (when you're lucky)
4. Normal Approximation (when the CLT applies)


## Step 3

. . .

Calculate a measure of consistency between the observed test statistic (the data) and the null distribution (i.e., a p-value).

- If your observed test stat is in the tails > low p-val > data is inconsistent
with null hypothesis > "reject null hypothesis".
- If your observed test stat is in the body > high p-val > data is consistent with the null hypothesis > "fail to reject the null hypothesis".

[UHS tests a sample of the Cal community every week and monitors the positivity rate (proportion of tests that are positive).]{.fragment} [Assume this is a random sample of constant size and that the test is perfectly accurate.]{.fragment} [Let $p$ be the positivity rate.]{.fragment}

# Error Rates and Statistical Power


## Decision Errors Rates

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/decision-error-rates.jpg")
```


## What affects the error rates?

- **Sample size, $n$**: with increasing $n$, the variability of the null distribution will decrease.

- **Changing $\alpha$**: decreasing $\alpha$ will decrease type I error but increase type II error.

- **Increasing _effect size_**: change data collection process to separate the distribution under $H_A$ and decrease type II error.
    - Ex: If you're testing whether a pain medicine provides pain relief, only conduct the test if using a medicine that you expect to have cause a dramatic decrease in pain.


## {}

::: poll
Consider a setting where the Cal UHS testing system observes a positivity rate of 5.5% in a one week interval, double the previous week.  Administration needs to decide whether or not to move  to remote learning. Which error would be worse?

A. Moving to remote instruction when in fact the true number of cases on campus is still low.

B. Failing to move to remote instruction when in fact the true number of cases on campus is elevated.

## Statistical Power

**Power** is the probability that you will reject the null hypothesis if it is in fact false.

$$ P(\textrm{reject } H_0 | H_0 \textrm{ is false}) $$

. . .

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> The more power, the higher the probability of finding an effect.
