# Constructing a Summary
## Inclusion and Omission

---
## Summarizing Data
--

Describing large and complex data most often involves a process of *summarization*.

--

.pull-left[
### What should I **include**?

- Relevant to claim I'm trying to make, question I'm trying to answer
- Aligned with audience interest
]

--

.pull-right[
### What should I **omit**?

- Distractions, deceptions
- Replicate or assumed information
]

* * *

> We'll call the criteria used to construct your summary the *desiderata*.

---
## Summarizing `bill_length` with graphics
--

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(kableExtra)
data(penguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  kbl()
```
]

.pull-right-wide[
```{r}
#| out.width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/culmen_depth.png")
```
]

---
**Desideratum**: all information must be preserved.

* * * 
--

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r}
data(penguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  kbl()
```
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = .1) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)
```

> This is called a **dot plot**.
]

---
**Desideratum**: balance general trends in the distribution with fidelity to the individual observations.

* * *
--

.pull-left-narrow[
1. Divide range of x into bins
2. Count number of obs. in each bin

> This is called a **histogram**.
]

.pull-right-wide[
```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

---
## Histogram: choice of binwidth
--

```{r}
#| fig.height: 8
#| fig.width: 16
library(patchwork)
p1 <- penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = .2) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20) +
  labs(title = "binwidth = .2") +
  lims(x = c(32.5, 42.5))
p2 <- penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = .5) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20) +
  labs(title = "binwidth = .5") +
  lims(x = c(32.5, 42.5))
p3 <- penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1.5) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20) +
  labs(title = "binwidth = 1.5") +
  lims(x = c(32.5, 42.5))
p4 <- penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20) +
  labs(title = "binwidth = 5") +
  lims(x = c(32.5, 42.5))
(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)
```

---
**Desiderata**:  
- Reveal summary statistics  
- Flag outliers
- Allow for easy comparisons between groups

* * *
--

.pull-left[
1. Center of box: median
2. Edges of box: Q1, Q3
3. Whiskers "most of the data"
4. Dots: outliers

> This is called a **boxplot**.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#| fig.height: 3
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  slice(1:16) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

???

Wait on boxplots until after doing summary statistics to show you can make a graphics of summary statistics (like the nyt heat dome scatterplot of maxes)

---
## Boxplots for comparison
--

```{r}
#| fig.height: 6
#| fig.width: 10
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```


---
## Describing the shape of distribution
--

**Modality**

```{r}
#| out.width: 800
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig.align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/modality.png")
```

--
**Skewness**

```{r}
#| out.width: 800
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig.align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/skewness.png")
```


---
# Shape Question 1

Which of these variables do you expect to be uniformly distributed?

1. bill length of Gentoo penguins
2. salaries of a random sample of people from California
3. house sale prices in San Francisco
4. birthdays of classmates (day of the month)

# Numerical Summaries
## What is typical?

--

$$8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11,  9,  6,  10,  7,  9$$


---
**Desideratum**: Synthesize the magnitudes of all of the observations into a single typical value that isn't too far from any of the observations.

* * *
--

1. Add up all of the observations.
2. Divide by the number of observations.

--

$$
\frac{8 + 11 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 7 + 9}{11} = \frac{93}{11} = 8.45
$$

--

More generally:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n}
$$

--

> This is the **arithmetic mean** of the data.


---
**Desideratum**:  Select a single typical value from the middle of the data, ignoring magnitudes.

* * * 

1. Put the data in order
2. Select the middle number
3. Average the middle two if necessary

--

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad {\Large 8} \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

> This is the **median**.

---
**Desideratum**:  Select the value that will most often be the same as one of the observations.

--
1. Select the most commonly observed value.

--

$$ 6 \quad {\Large 7 \quad 7 \quad  7} \quad 8 \quad 8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

> This is the **mode**.

# Which is best?

.task[
Get out a piece of paper. You'll be watching a 3 minute video that discusses characteristics of a typical human. Note which numerical summaries are used and what for.

## General Advice
--

1. *Means* are often a good default for symmetric data.

--

2. *Means* are sensitive to very large and small values, so can be deceptive on skewed data.
> Use a median

--

3. *Modes* are often the only option for categorical data.

--

But there are other notions of typical...
