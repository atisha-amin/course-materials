## Data defined


**Data:**
--
 (n) An item of (chiefly numerical) information, esp. one obtained by scientific work, a number of which are typically collected together for reference, analysis, or calculation.
--
 From latin *datum*: that which is given.
--
 Facts.
 
--

**Variable:**
--
 A characteristic of an object / unit that can be measured / recorded.

--

**Observations**: the collection of objects / units that are being measured / recorded.

## Types of Variables
--

**Numerical**:
--
 Variables that take numbers as values that are sensible to add, subtract, etc.
 
--

**Categorical**:
--
 Variables that take categories as values (called *levels*).

--

**Continuous**:
--
 A numerical variable that takes values on an interval of the real number line.
 
--

**Discrete**:
--
 A numerical variable that takes values that have jumps between them (i.e. an ordered countable set).
 
--

**Ordinal**:
--
 A categorical variable with levels that have a natural ordering.
 
--

**Nominal**:
--
 A categorical variable with levels with no ordering.

# The Data Frame

---
## Observing Penguins
--

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/palmer-station.jpeg")
```

### Palmer Station, Antarctica

*Size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica*, K. Gorman 2020.

---
## Variables: Beak Length, Beak Depth
--

```{r out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/culmen_depth.png")
```

--

> These are *continuous* variables.

---
## Variable: Species
--

```{r out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/lter_penguins.png")
```

--

> This is a nominal variable.

---
## The Data Frame

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  sample_n(4) %>%
  kbl()
```

A **data frame** is an array that associates the *observations* (downs the rows) with the *variables* measured on each observation (across the columns). Each cell storse a **value** observed for a variable on an observation.

--

**Unit of observation**:
--
 The type of the object on which the variables are observed.
 
--
> Here: an adult foraging *penguin* near Palmer Station, Antarctica

---
## Non-tidy Data Frames
--

From Wikipedia, a *contingency table* of sex and handedness.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/non-tidy-contingency-table.png")
```

.task[
What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables?
]

---
## Non-tidy Data Frames

From the `stat20.org`, the schedule.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/non-tidy-schedule.png")
```

.task[
What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables?
]

---
## Non-tidy Data Frames

From the World Bank, the number of hospital beds.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/non-tidy-world-bank.png")
```

.task[
What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables?
]

---
## For next time

.pull-left[
1. Take the survey and "turn it in" to Gradescope by Monday 8 pm.

2. Get help on Lab 1 in at Evening Study Session, at office hours, on Ed.

3. Take a look at the readings for next week.
