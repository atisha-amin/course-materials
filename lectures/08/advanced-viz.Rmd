## Mapping vs Setting
--

**Mapping** is the dynamic link between the values in a column of your data frame and an aesthetic attribute of your plot.

--

**Setting** is a static way to tweak the look of your plot that does *not* reference the data frame.

--

> Mapping is done within `aes()`. Setting is done outside `aes()`, generally in a `geom_()`.


---
.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp=1}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") + #<<
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

---
## Which colors are available?
--

By default, R uses the following, but there are many packages that contain built-in palettes.

```{r}
colors()
```

## Takeaway

--

If you want to change the look of your plot because of structure in the data, you're thinking about *mapping*.

--

If you want to just fiddle with the look, you can adjust the *settings*.

# Adding labels for clarity

---

```{r fig.width = 9.2, fig.height = 7}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```

> What is the main point of this plot?

---
## Adding a title with `labs()`
--

The *plot title* should convey the main point / story in the plot.

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species") #<<
```
]

--

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 14)
```


---
## Modifying axis labels
--

*Axis labels* should be clear and cleanly formatted.

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species",
       x = "Bill length (mm)", #<<
       y = "Bill depth (mm)", #<<
       color = "Species") #<<
```
]

--

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 14)
```



---
## Adding a caption
--

*Captions* can contain citations and/or expanded versions of the title.

--

.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species",
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package") #<<
```
]

--

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = .7}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Beak sizes differ between species",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species",
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 14)
```

## Takeaway

--

The plot title can be used to convey the main point.

Axis labels should be clear and clean.

       y = "Prop. girls") +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 16)
```

---
## The Importance of Scale
--

You can alter the scale on which the data is presented by changing the limits of the axis.

--

- `xlim(<LOWER>, <UPPER>)`
- `ylim(<LOWER>, <UPPER>)`

--

```{r, fig.width=4.5, fig.asp = 1}

  mutate(prop_girls = girls / (girls + boys)) %>%

  geom_line() +

# Overplotting

---

## From the lab ...

> What is the relationship between students’ optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?

--

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.asp=1}
data(class_survey)
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```

---
## Overplotting
--

.pull-left[
**Overplotting** is a common effect where multiple observations overlap with one another in a plot.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.asp=1}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 11)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Selected fixes:

1. Jittering the points

2. Adding transparency

3. Different geometries (hex plot, contour plots)
]

---
## Jittering
--

**Jittered** points have random noise added to both coordinates to separate them from one another.

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_jitter() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width=6.5, fig.asp=1}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```
]

---
## Transparency
--

Points can be made transparent by setting the **alpha** level. Alpha = 1: normal opaque points, Alpha = 0, fully transparent points.

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1, size = 8) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width=6.5, fig.asp=1}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1, size = 8)
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```
]

---
## Jittered and transparent
--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .1, size = 8) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.width=6.5, fig.asp=1}
class_survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tech_relationships,
             y = crypto)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .3, size = 8) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```
]

---
class: middle, center

## Takeaway

--

Plots with substantial overplotting are very misleading. It can be fixed with jittering, transparency, and geometries that aggregate.

> What other design decisions were made in constructing this plot?

---
## Themes

Many of the subtle visual design decisions - background colors, fonts, guidelines, axis tick marks, border boxes - are part of a plots **theme**. These can be changed easily by adding a new theme layer.

--

- `theme_<NAME>()`


---
## Themes in `ggplot2`

  mutate(prop_girls = girls / (girls + boys)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = prop_girls))+

  labs(title = "theme_classic()",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Prop. girls") +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  theme_classic()
p3 <- arbuthnot %>%

       x = "Year",
       y = "Prop. girls") +
