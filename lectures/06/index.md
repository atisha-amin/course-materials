There is a wide range of plot types that have been developed to summarize data in different ways. The Grammar of Graphics is one way to unite these diverse practices into a simple and powerful framework.

### Key Questions

- (Introduction: What are three measures of the spread of a distribution? When is each one most useful?)
- What are the free principle layers involved in the Grammar of Graphics?
- Can you identify the aesthetic mapping used in a graphic to link variables to a data frame to visual cues / aesthetics in the plot?
- Which aesthetics are used by different plot geometries?
- Which geometries and mappings best address the question you're trying to answer / claim you're trying to make?


### Terminology and Skills

- Measures of spread: range, IQR, MAD, variance, standard deviation
- Grammar of Graphics: data, aesthetic mappings, and geometries
