> There are two new food delivery services that open in Berkeley: Oski Eats and Cal Cravings. A friend of yours that took Stat 20 collected data on each and noted that Oski Eats has a mean delivery time of 29 minutes and Cal Cravings a mean delivery time of 27 minutes. Which would would you rather order from?

---

```{r}
#| fig.height = 7.5,
#| fig.width = 12
set.seed(513)
oski <- rnorm(23, 0, 2)
oski <- oski + (29 - mean(oski))
cal <- rnorm(23, 0, 8)
cal <- cal +  (27 - mean(cal))
df <- tibble(service = rep(c("oski", "cal"), each = 23),
             time = c(oski, cal))
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(service), nrow = 2) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
p1
```

---

```{r}
#| fig.height = 7.5,
#| fig.width = 12
p1 + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 27, color = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 29, color = "goldenrod", lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```

> Would you still prefer to order from Cal?

## Summarizing Distributions of Data
--

You can construct a **statistical graphic** to show the **shape**, which you can describe in terms of **modality** and **skew**,...
--
you can calculate a **measure of center** to convey a sense of a typical observation...
--
and you can calculate a **measure of spread** to capture how much variability there is in the data.

---

---
## Measures of spread
--

How can we express the variability in this data set using a single number?

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

.pull-left[
**Desiderata**
- The statistic should be *low* when the numbers are the same or very similar to one another.
- The statistic should be *high* when the numbers are very different.
- The statistic should not grow or shrink with the sample size ( $n$ ).
]

.pull-right[
Existing statistics to utilize:

- sample size ( $n$ ): 11
- sample mean ( $\bar{x}$ ): 8.45
- sample median: 8
- sample mode: 7
]

---

$$ {\Large 6} \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad {\Large 11}$$

--

### The Range

$$\textrm{range:} \quad max - min$$

--

$$ 11 - 6 = 5$$

--

**Characteristics**

- Very sensitive to extreme values!


---

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad {\Large 7 \quad  7} \quad 8 \quad  {\large 8} \quad 9 \quad {\Large 9 \quad 10} \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

### The Inner Quartile Range (IQR)

The difference between the median of the larger half of the sorted data set, $Q_3$, and the median of the smaller half, $Q_1$.

$$\textrm{IQR:} \quad Q_3 - Q_1$$

--

$$ 9.5 - 7 = 2.5 $$

--

**Characteristics**

- Robust to outliers
- Used to set the width of the box in a boxplot

---

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

### Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, take their absolute values, add them up, and divide by $n$ .

$$MAD: \quad \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - \bar{x}| $$

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sum(abs(x - mean(x)))/11
```

$$ MAD = 1.4 $$

--

**Characteristics**

- Incorporates information from all observations
- Robust to extreme values


---

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

### Sample Variance

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, square them, add them up, and divide by $n - 1$ .

$$s^2: \quad \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(11-1)
var(x)
```

$$ s^2 = 2.87 $$

--

**Characteristics**

- Incorporates information from all observations
- Moderately sensitive to extreme values


---

$$ 6 \quad 7 \quad 7 \quad  7 \quad 8 \quad  8 \quad 9 \quad 9 \quad 10 \quad 11  \quad 11$$

--

### Sample Standard Deviation

Take the differences from each observation, $x_i$, to the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, square them, add them up, divide by $n - 1$, then take the square root.

$$s: \quad \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} $$

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11)
sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(11-1))
sd(x)
```

$$ s = 1.70 $$

--

**Characteristics**

- Incorporates information from all observations
- Moderately sensitive to extreme values
- Measured in units of the original data

---
## Deliveries revisited

.pull-left[
```{r}
#| fig.height = 7.5,
#| fig.width = 12
library(kableExtra)
p1 + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 27, color = "blue", lty = 1, lwd = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 29, color = "goldenrod", lty = 1, lwd = 2)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(service) %>%
  summarize(range = diff(range(time)),
            IQR = IQR(time),
            var = var(time),
            sd = sd(time)) %>%
  kbl(digits = 1)
```

**Desiderata**
- The statistic should be *low* when the numbers are the same or very similar to one another.
- The statistic should be *high* when the numbers are very different.
- The statistic should not grow or shrink with the sample size ( $n$ ).

# Statistics as Science

---

You will be watching a 2.5 minute video of a presentation by a scientist, Hans Roslings, who studied global public health. He presents data visualizations depicting the change in life expectancy and family size over several decades in the 20th century.

> On a piece of note paper, jot down each of the "dimensions" in his data visualization, i.e. the number of separate variables that are depicted graphically. You will be be sharing these after the video.

.task[Please turn to a neighbor and:

1. Introduce yourself
  - Name
  - One important fact

2. Discuss which dimensions you were able to identify. That includes:
  - the variables present in the data frame
  - the visual cues that encode that data in the plot]

```{r}
countdown::countdown(4)
```


---
## What dimensions could you identify?
--

.pull-left[
**Visual Cues / Aesthetics**
- Location along the x-axis
- Location along the y-axis
- Size of point
- Color of point
- Animation
]

--

.pull-right[
**Variables**
- Fertility rate
- Life expectancy
- Population
- Region
- Year
]


---
## What did the data frame look like?
--

What was the unit of observation? What were the variables? What were their type?

--

**Unit of observation**: A country in a given year

**Variables**: Fertility rate (continuous), Life expectancy (continuous), Population (continuous),  Region (nominal), Year (discrete)

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## don't use the gapminder package data. Remake to have the original vars: life expectancy and fertility rate
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>%
  slice(1, 10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
```

---
## What geometry is used to represent the observations?

--

- Points


---
## Grammar of Graphics

Wilkinson 1999: A statistical graphic is a **mapping** of **data** variables to **aesthetic** attributes of **geometric** objects.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/grammar-of-graphics.png")
# source: http://bloggotype.blogspot.com/2016/08/holiday-notes2-grammar-of-graphics.html
```

---
## 3 Questions to ask of every plot
--

1. **Data**: What data frame do I want to depict?

--

2. **Aesthetics**: How do I want to map the variables of that data frame to the aesthetic attributes of the plot?

--

3. **Geometry**: How do I want to graphically depict the observations?


---
## Aesthetic Mapping
--

The most fundamental part of the Grammar of Graphics is the choice of **mapping** *variables* in a data frame to the *aesthetics* of the plot.

.pull-left[
**Visual Cues / Aesthetics**
- Location along the x-axis
- Location along the y-axis
- Size of point
- Color of point
- Animation
]

.pull-right[
**Variables**
- Fertility rate
- Life expectancy
- Population
- Region
- Year
]

## Grammar of Graphics in R

Wickham 2005: `ggplot2` package (inside `tidyverse`) proposes a general template:


```{css, echo = FALSE}
.huge .remark-code { /*Change made here*/
  font-size: 150% !important;
}
```

.huge[
```
ggplot(<DATA>, aes(<ATTR> = <VAR>)) +
    geom()
```
]

## A ggplot for Arbuthnot
--

```{r}
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = girls + boys)
```

.pull-left[
- **Data**: `arbuthnot`  
- **Aesthetic Mapping**: map `year` to the x-axis, and `total` count to the y-axis
- **Geometry**: express the observations as a line  

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = total)) +
  geom_line()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = total)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

---
## A second ggplot for Arbuthnot
--

```{r}
library(stat20data)
data(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = girls + boys)
```

.pull-left[
- **Data**: `arbuthnot`  
- **Aesthetic Mapping**: map `year` to the x-axis, and `total` count to the y-axis
- **Geometry**: express the observations as **points**. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = total)) +
  geom_point() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = year,
                      y = total)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]

---
## A third ggplot for Arbuthnot
--

data(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = girls + boys)
```

.pull-left[

- **Aesthetic Mapping**: map `girls` to the x-axis, and `boys` count to the y-axis
- **Geometry**: express the observations as points. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = girls, #<<
                      y = boys)) + #<<
  geom_point()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(arbuthnot, aes(x = girls,
                      y = boys)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)
```
]
