### Key Questions
- What distinguishes a probability distribution from a distribution of a data set?
- What are parameters and how are they related to probability distributions?
- How can you find the probability of non-disjoint events?
- What are random variables and what notation do they use?
- What are the defining characteristics of the Bernoulli and Uniform distributions and how can they be used to model real-world data generating processes?


### Terminology and Skills
- Probability distribution
- Parameter
- Random variable notation: $X$, $x$, $P(X = x)$, $X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p)$, $X \sim \textrm{Unif}(a, b)$
