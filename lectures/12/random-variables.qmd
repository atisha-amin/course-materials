::: smalladage
A description of the **process that generated** the data.
:::

## Questions we seek to answer

1.  How can we use a sample of *data* to reason about a particular *data generating process*?

2.  How can we account for the uncertainty caused by *sampling variability*?

3.  How does uncertainty decrease as we increase *sample size*?

4.  How can we identify and deal with *statistical bias*?

## Probability distributions

A **probability distribution** of a discrete (random) data generating process encompasses all possible outcomes of a variable along with their respective probabilities.

They can be expressed as tables or bar charts.

<br>

**Properties**

1.  The outcomes must be disjoint (mutually exclusive).
2.  Each probability must be between 0 and 1.
3.  The probabilities must sum to 1.

# Random Variables

## Random Variable

A **random variable** is...

-   A random process with a numerical outcome
-   A mapping from the outcome space to the real number line

. . .

It also comes with a helpful and compact notation.

## Random Variable Notation

Random variables are indicated by capital letters near the end of the alphabet.

$$ X, Y, Z, W $$

. . .

The values that a random variable can take are indicated by lowercase equivalents.

$$ x, y, z, w $$

. . .

The following statement reads, "The probability that the random variable $X$ takes the value $x$".

$$ P(X = x) $$

# Fundamental Distributions

## Bernoulli Distribution

. . .

A random variable $X$ has a Bernoulli distribution if it has only two outcomes, 1 and 0, (known as "success" and "failure", respectively) and a probability of success $p$.

$$ X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p) $$

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c("1", "0"),
             `P(X = x)` = c("p", "1 - p"))
df %>%
  kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
:::

::: {.column width="\"50%"}
```{r}
#| fig.height: 8
df <- tibble(x = c("1", "0"),
             Probability = c(.33, .67))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bern(p = .33)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 40) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## Fair-coin flip as a Bern

Let an outcome of $H$ be considered a 1 and $T$ considered a 0. Then we can model the outcome of a fair coin flip using $X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p = .5)$.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.align: center
df <- tibble(x = c("1", "0"),
             Probability = c(.5, .5))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bern(p = .5)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Spinning globe as a Bern

Let an outcome of $Water$ be considered a 1 and $Land$ considered a 0. Then we can model the outcome of our spinning globe using $X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p = .71)$.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.align: center
df <- tibble(x = c("1", "0"),
             Probability = c(.71, .29))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bern(p = .71)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Fair 3-sided coin as a Bern

Let an outcome of $S$ be considered a 1 and $\{H, T\}$ considered a 0. Then we can model the outcome of our 3-sided coin using $X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p = .33)$.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.align: center
df <- tibble(x = c("1", "0"),
             Probability = c(.33, .67))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Bern(p = .33)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Uniform Distribution

. . .

A random variable $X$ has a discrete uniform distribution on the integers between $a$ and $b$ (inclusive) if each integer in the interval is equally likely.

$$ X \sim \textrm{Unif}(a, b) \textrm{, with } n = b - a + 1 \textrm{ outcomes }$$

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c("a", "a + 1", "...", "b - 1", "b"),
             `P(X = x)` = c("1/n", "1/n", "...", "1/n", "1/n"))
df %>%
  kbl(align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
:::

::: {.column width="\"50%"}
```{r}
#| fig.height: 7
df <- tibble(x = 0:3,
             Probability = c(.25, .25, .25, .25))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Unif(0, 3)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 40) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
:::
:::

## Die roll as a Uniform

We can model the number of pips appearing on one roll of a fair six-sided die as $X \sim \textrm{Unif}(a = 1, b = 6)$.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.align: center
df <- tibble(x = factor(1:6),
             Probability = rep(1/6, 6))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Unif(1, 6)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Fair coin flip as a Uniform

Let an outcome of $H$ be considered a 1 and $T$ considered a 0. Then we can model the outcome of a fair coin flip using $X \sim \textrm{Unif}(a = 0, b = 1)$.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig.height: 5
#| fig.width: 5
#| fig.align: center
df <- tibble(x = factor(0:1),
             Probability = c(.5, .5))
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x,
             y = Probability,)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#EFBE43", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Unif(0, 1)") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
