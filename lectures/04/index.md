While the data frame is a natural format for storing categorical data for analysis, it makes it difficult to see broader trends. Counts and proportions can be used to summarize this form of data and they can be displayed effectively either in tables or bar charts.


### Key Questions
- What numerical and graphical methods are available for displaying categorical data?
- What is the difference in the structure of data frames and contingency tables and what is each used for?
- What is the link between conditional proportions and a stacked, normalized bar chart?
- What can conditional proportions tell us about an association between two variables? What would that association look like graphically?

### Terminology and Skills
- Contingency table
- Response and explanatory variables
- Marginal, joint, and conditional proportions
- Bar charts: plain, stacked, normalized, and side-by-side
